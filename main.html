                            I can't forget everything 
                            I found him in mobile legend and I met him<bR>
                            This is what happens.<br>
                            I'm bored with my main acc-(account). <bR>
                            I created a Smurf account to beat up weak players.<bR>
                            I used to play solo 10 games<bR>
                            It's fun because it's easy to win in a low-rank.<bR>
                            After I reached 20 games I'm no longer happy, because I'm bored.<bR>
                            I was looking for my party mate back then in the world chat on ml.<bR>
                            I started looking for maybe that afternoon.<bR>
                            I've talked to a lot of girls before but I don't trip to chat with girls.<bR>
                            11 pm i looked at the world chat on ml<bR>
                            I saw Daddy's Girl.<bR>
                            I hurried to chat with him then and then I said "HI!" to him.<bR>
                            I don't expect him to reply to me<bR>
                            And she follows my account and I follow back.<br>
                            That's where our conversation started and I made the topic.<bR>
                            I asked her name age and what her name Daddy's Girl means .<bR>
                            She told me because she said she was papas girls so daddy's girl.<bR>
                            Maybe about 30mins we also talked that we were done about 12 .<bR>
                            Because she was already asleep.<bR>
                            After that the next day we didn't use to chat.<bR>
                            I played with other's random player's.

                            After a month of playing with random player's. <br>
                            I was surprised because Daddy's girl invited me to play duo.<br>
                            I accepted and we played.<br>
                            After 1 game of playing,<br>
                            she said she was a hangover<br>
                            I know and I found out that she was drinking.<br>
                            That's what I don't like most about women.<br>
                            But I believed that someday she choose to change her personality for her love. <br>
                            I hope she understands what I mean. <bR>
                            She used to invite me all the time.<br>
                            We were playing but no chat happened.<br>
                            I was amazed because every time we would play,<br>
                            She trash-talked the opponents.<br>
                            I liked him there because of<br>
                            she's a bit rude to play<br>
                            For me, she was cool when I met him because she was a trashtalker.<br>
                            Until we were always playing.<br>
                            I'm not sure who was the first to chat with us then,<br>
                            And that's when we chatted but at that time I didn't know his language.<br>
                            So we used to talk Tagalog. <br>
                            Until it was found out that she was from Cebu.<br>
                            I told her if she knows how to speak Visayas cause I think she is Cebuana.<br>
                            Then she replies "Ambot lang".<br>
                            Then I laugh because his type of woman wants me to like him.<br>
                            And I also reply in the lobby chat "buang" cause she says "ambot lang".<br>
                            And she reply "Ikaw ra buang" and I started laughing again HAHA.<br>
                            I'm glad because our language is the same,<br>
                            I think it will be easier for us to talk if we use our real language.<br>  
                            We played again,<br>  
                            in we always play and we are both trashtalker.<br>  
                            The other random players we met had open mics.<br>  
                            And we hear them talking.<br>  
                            And they told us that we are jowa and we laugh on the chat box.<br>  
                            Maybe they said that because of us playing so annoying.<br>  
                            Just trash talk per game.<br>  
                            Daddy's girl and I had the same vibes when we played.

                            After a few days I found out that Daddy's girl. <br>
                            Has a lot of boyfriends or maybe flirting with other guys.<br>
                            Because I always see him play and I see from him, she is not like that before<br>
                            Cause she always invited me to play when I'm online .<br>
                            But that time she is so busy playing with other . <br>
                            So I don't have the right to stop what she doing. <br>
                            The cause was not in a relationship but maybe a duo only.<br>
                            I started feeling doubt about her.<br>
                            I check her history and I saw that she had another duo.<br>
                            Then I feel jealous of that. <br>
                            I'm restless I want to know who his dou.<br>
                            I'd started searching for his duo to know what their relations. <br>
                            And there's a guy that Daddy's girl is within the game.<br>
                            Because he gave her a gift just buying diamonds.<br>
                            We use the same language.<br>
                            Daddy's girl invited me with her duo<br>
                            And then she spoke there in the chat box ingame.<br>
                            And she said something that hurt me.<br>
                            The word she say is "Pag storya mung duha kay inyu ko gaawayan or ilugan".<br>
                            It really means that she's not serious with me.<br>
                            I realize that it's been a month since we played together.<br>
                            I don't seem to take advantage of our constant togetherness.<br>
                            The man she talked to me then was very rude.<br>
                            She said what is the relationship with Daddy's girl.<br>
                            I said we don't have a relationship, she's just my duo.<br>
                            She said rude words that the woman didn't like.<br>
                            He insulted Daddy's girl but I didn't say anything to daddy's girl that time.<br>
                            Until now I still keep it a secret.<br>
                            So I wondered why Daddy's girl wanted<br>
                            Men love sex chats and say sexual words or bad words.<br>
                            Because of what happened, I was hurt when I found out.<br>
                            She even preferred to play and chat with that rude guy.<br>
                            I was offline for 2 days, I had no plans to go back to ml.<br>
                            But I accidentally click my ml app while cleaning my house.<br>
                            And I read his chat,<br>
                            and she said that she left the guy and that she would choose to be with me.<br>

                            We are back to normal, we are playing again,<br>
                            but she still has other male/boys playmates. <br>
                            and I just ignore it.<br>
                            Until we came together still in September. <br>
                            Daddy's girl decides to make a smurf.<br>
                            And she named it Erika?.<br>
                            And I asked her if her real name was Erika .<br>
                            And the answer is yes Erika is her real name.<br>
                            I also create a another smurf to accompany him to rank up.<br>
                            We chat every day.<br>
                            Always lsm (long sweet message).<br>
                            Even though I'm cleaning the house, my cellphone is turned on, <br>
                            So I can replay him right away when she message me.<br>
                            We always talk and we share what we did today like we update each other.<br>
                            Erika doesn't tell the truth to herself.<br>
                            That was the first thing I liked about him.<br>
                            Because it's right she shouldn't trust me right away.<br>
                            Because we don't know each other yet.<br>
                            Erika never told me about her social media.<br>
                            Like FB or Instagram but I also have no intention of asking him.<br>
                            Because I don't want him to think I'm rushing him.<br>
                            Maybe this is the time when I feel I'm so in love. <br>
                            My heart is so heavy and complicated at that time.<br>
                            This is the time I overthink to him.<br>
                            She never left my mind even though I took an online class. <br>
                            That she distracted me from my mind.<br>
                            When I wake up in the morning,<br>
                            I look for my phone to go online immediately .<br>
                            And see if she messages me with "GOOD MORNING".<br>
                            When I saw if she texted me good morning.<br>
                            I'm very happy because she was great to me in the morning.<br>

                            The month of September is the one I will never forget.<br>
                            Because this is the "FIRST TIME I CRY".<br>
                            The reason is that Erika has been offline for 1 and a half days. <br>
                            And I have no clue<br>
                            And I couldn't handle that, I was very depressed on September 29 to 30<br>
                            Because Erika is not online on that day.<br>
                            I cried in my room.<br>
                            I waited for 10 hours, I didn't turn off my cellphone.<br>
                            My mom came into my room and saw me crying.<br>
                            My mother was quiet at the time and didn't want to talk to me. <br>
                            She saw my eyes red and there were tears in my eyes and she knows I'm crying that time.<br>
                            But I didn't tell him the reason why I'm crying.<br>
                            Because she hasn't seen me cry like that, especially when I'm older.<br>
                            I'm waiting for Erika to go online .<Br>
                            I always look at my friend list if his name is online. <Br>
                            I cried a lot that night. <BR>
                            I can't go out of my room even outside the house.<bR>
                            And tomorrow September 30.<bR>
                            I still waited like I did yesterday.<bR>
                            And she finally went online at 4 pm .<bR>
                            I cried a lot and I was very happy because she came back(tears of joy)<bR>
                            And this is what she told me after she returned.<bR>
                            (Hi love sorry love karun pako ka online nag tabang man gud ko hatag2 og pagkaon sa lubong sakong angkol)<br>
                            Huhuhu I'm really happy because she's online I can't stop I'm crying.

                            We started playing again.<br> 
                            And then we started letting each other know what we were going to do.<br> 
                            Similar to going out of the house with friends outside and drinking.<br> 
                            Sometimes I tell him she won't drink anymore.<br> 
                            Because I don't like women who drink.<br> 
                            But she was so stubborn she would not listening to me.<br> 
                            Sometimes I get disappointed .<br> 
                            Sometimes I lose chances to be us in the future.<br> 
                            I always tell her that the man she chooses .<br> 
                            Is kind and will love you very much and the man has a future and hard working.<br> 
                            Maybe I thought of those things.<br> 
                            Because I would like her life to be good in the future .<br> 
                            Because I love this girl.<br>
                            All the things we want are compatible.<br>
                            Both in color and in food and music.<br>
                            We both like it <br>
                            Until the month of November came the day of the dead (hallowen). <br> 
                            And we told wonderful stories about ghosts or something connected to Halloween story.<br> 
                            We shared our stories and we rate the story how good the story was<br> 
                            For me, that memory is very fun<br> 
                            The first time I have hallowen story chat.<br> 
                            Very fun that day as it takes me more to in love with him.<br> 
                            Sometimes we planned to change our call sign.<br>
                            Because I'm jealous of the number of men you chat with, your call sign and ours are still the same.<br>
                            But you said don't change the call sign of us because you love me,<br>
                            so let's just call love so our call sign is still in the same. <br>
                            Sometimes when I have a duo, she acts jealous.<br>
                            maybe she's just tripping to be jealous pretending to say he loves me.<br>
                            Because Erika tends to play with people.<br>
                            So you can't say what she said is true<br>
                            I always doubted him.

                            Erika said that she is 17 and will have her birthday next year.<br>
                            But she did not immediately say the date.<br>
                            Maybe because she doesn't trust me<br>
                            Erika wants to admit something about me,<br>
                            And she said she had a heart disease.<br>
                            I didn't believe it at first<br>
                            I thought so much because of his illness.<br>
                            He told me if I would still accept him even if she had a heart disease.<br>
                            And I answered “YES” because your heart disease is not a barrier to our love<br>
                            I will accept you even if your illness is serious, which is still very critical.<br>
                            I'm not the man who just because of heart disease, i don't like you anymore.<br>
                            Maybe the other guys are like that <br>
                            But I'm different so I always tell you not to compare me to others.<br>
                            Erika also told about the death of her mother.<br>
                            I can't go to that topic because it's private.<br>
                            Maybe because of what he said I was happy and of course I was also sad, because I was happy for a long time, he trusted me and shared .<br>
                            His personal background information of his family and especially himself.

                            There was a storm in December near Christmas <br>
                            And lost signal and Visayas and Mindanao <br>
                            I watched the news on tv and I saw it in Cebu .<br>
                            Massive damage was inflicted on Cebu they had the center of the typhoon.<br>
                            I'm worried about what happened to Erika  if she's okay or not.<br>
                            3days after before the signals back, but it was still unstable.<br>
                            But after 5 days he went online, she said she was using wifi with his friend<br>
                            And she just told the story of what happened in their place.<br>
                            I'm happy because she's ok<br>
                            After that, we just enjoy happy CHRISTMAS and NEWYEAR<br>
                            But he said she had a heart attack on Dec 27. <br>
                            I'm not sure but when he said that, it seems true because it's like he's not lying<br>
                            She didn't immediately tell me about that,I was really worried about him.<br>
                            I almost cried then but he said she was ok.
                            <br>This girl made me worried always

                            It's the new year and it's almost January 6<br>
                            On January 4 erika and her family they went to the hotel, Since his sister's birthday.<br>
                            and my birthday also is on January 6.<br>
                            My birthday came and I regretted it<br>
                            Because I wasn't online for my birthday.<br>
                            I didn't think of Erika because I was preparing for the myday <br>
                            Because my friends would come to my house that day.<br>
                            She's mad at me because I'm not online all the time.<br>
                            Maybe she was worried about me.<br>
                            And on his birthday on February 7<br>
                            She was online<br>
                            I thought she would enjoy himself with his fam and friends.<br>
                            But she still chose to go online to ml and chatting with me.<br>
                            I didn't sleep on February 6, I looked forward to midnight/12pm on February 7 and<br>
                            I started great with happy birthday and messages on her birthday.<br>
                            I gave him a great happy birthday and gave him nice messages.<br>
                            I remember she album images in ml, then she took a screenshot of our chat.<br>
                            And we had a dating chat on valentines<br>
                            I sent advance happy valentines at 1am.<br>
                            We're still fighting a bit now<br>
                            We don't talk today and she ignores me.<br>
                            The next day was Valentine's Day, she texted me Happy Valentines.<br>
                            I'm really happy when she's the first to chat with us, because I always wait for him to chat with me because she doesn't always ignores me when we fight.

                            We always fight that month<br>
                            Because of jealousy or misunderstanding<br>
                            maybe I always doubt<br>
                            Because she is the type of girl who always wants to chat with other boys.<br>
                            Until it got to the point where we no longer felt like chatting with each other.<br>
                            The height of our pride<br>
                            There is no humility in us<br>
                            Maybe we haven't chatted for 5 days<br>
                            We were just playing with ourselves.<br>
                            Then that night she Chatted with me she said "HI"<br>
                            "Mingaw manko nimo oy kung wala ko mingaw di taka chatan ba"<br>
                            And then she seems weird to chat<br>
                            I feel she was drunk at that time<br>
                            and she told me she was drunk for 5 days.<br>
                            I didn't know why she always use to drunk.<br>
                            Because she always says "Promise di nako mag inom, Stop nako ana"<br>
                            I wanted to be angry with him, but I didn't do it<br>
                            cause point came when it was thought to lower the pride<br>
                            I'll just take care of him<br>
                            I always understand him in anything<br>
                            Then I was in school then<br>
                            I read his message that his account was hacked<br>
                            I saw that his daddy's girl unfollowed me on his account<br>
                            At first I didn't want to believe because he only unfollowed my account<br>
                            Then I try to retrieve his account<br>
                            Then I tried to get his account back to him<br>
                            But it's really impossible to get it back<br>
                            i asked him if I could get his gmail because it was bound to his gmail<br>
                            but he didn't give it because maybe he didn't trust me<br>
                            and he said the hacker changed his gmail account<br>
                            That's why I didn't force him<br>
                            I can't say that it's a hack for me, that it's really a scam
                            He created a new account then she named it " iring.!. " HAHAHA.<br>
                            I'm happy because he named the nickname I gave him.

                            then after now, we are still talking happily.<br>
                            I didn't expect that we would be in ml for one year.<br>
                            I think that maybe we can talk only in ml.<br>
                            I'm just really waiting for him to give his "you know" what I mean.<br>
                            But I didn't think of that<br>
                            I told him how long I would have to wait<br>
                            It's ok with me even if it's a few years or it's took a long<br>
                            She said (2) I knew right away what 2 meant<br>
                            She also said that she was 16 and not 18<br>
                            I was surprised there<br>
                            Because we've been together for a year but I was fooled<br>
                            I believe that she has been 18 for 1 year<br>
                            So I will never really lose my doubts about him.<br>
                            I always doubted because she didn't tell the truth<br>
                            As for me, I don't know him yet<br>
                            Even his face was not seen<br>
                            But I do not regret that I met him<br>
                            I am so happy because I met this girl that you are happy to talk to<br>
                            Just the same vibes and we understand each other in everything.
                            So think how much I love you<br>
                            I accompany you in everything<br>
                            I want to give all my time to you.

                            In April, we were just fighting and teasing in the chat.<br>  
                            I always tease him because she gets angry easily.<br>  
                            I know it's scary for him to be angry with me.<br>  
                            but I noticed something about him<br>  
                            even though we were chatting, she suddenly played.<br>  
                            I don't know who she's playing with in ml, but I know if she's playing with another guy and I'm sure of that<br>  
                            but I was surprised that she was not the same as before, cause she doesn't play when we chat<br>  
                            she might only play once, but this is strange<br>  
                            because she kept playing even though I was waiting for him to finish.<br>  
                            after she plays....Suddenly she started again without chatting with me<br>  
                            when I stalked him I couldn't see anything.<br>  
                            because when I stalk her, there are always many boys stalking her and that's not new to me.<br>  
                            I just let him go, maybe she just has a problem with me or I don't know the reason.

                            The month of May, I don't know why but she always fights with me<br>  
                            his chats with me are not like before.<br>  
                            she seems to have changed<br>  
                            she treats me like someone else who doesn't know me that well.<br>  
                            I was really surprised because she changed his attitude towards me.<br>  
                            she doesn't chat with me anymore.<br>  
                            It's like she's playing with someone else<br>  
                            It's just like my brain is going to explode again because I'm always overthinking useless things.<br>  
                            I know that she is playing with someone else besides me.<br>  
                            but even so, she used to pay attention to me, but now she doesn't.<br>  
                            It's like she's pimping me out when I'm chatting and avoiding me when I'm online.

                            I went online one day and chatted with him.<br>
                            I tried if she still replies quickly and I will tease him<br>
                            If she gets angry and she still does what she did to me, it means she has someone else.<br> 
                            I made him angry and I pissed him flat<br>
                            She unfollowed me<br>  
                            I thought it was a normal unfollow.<br>  
                            It's been 2 or 3 days since she didn't follow back.<br>  
                            I waited for maybe 2 weeks<br>  
                            seriously she never came back.<br>  
                            I was sad about that<br>  
                            this girl always hurts me and doesn't even think about me.<br>  
                            if she was going to leave, she should have said what was the reason for me to stop chasing him.<br>  
                            I was overthinking if something wrong had been done to him because she didn't come back, I was very sad and depress because of what she did.<br>  
                            I have been online for a few weeks, maybe 2 weeks.

                            I went online after 2 weeks.<br>  
                            I didn't even stalk him because I still followed him.<br>  
                            I saw his rank rise and she immediately reached the mythic.<br>  
                            I don't know how she did that<br>  
                            but I know that someone is lifting him<br>  
                            I saw that she doesn't want to follow me back anymore.<br>  
                            I really miss her<br>  
                            I can't wait, I want to chat with him.<br>  
                            I can't think of a way to make him come back to me<br>  
                            that's why I'm thinking of quitting ML<br>

                            6 months a lot happened in my life<br>  
                            many happy memories and memorable sorrows.<br>  
                            I went online on ml in December, I think December 26, I'm not sure or dec 23<br>  
                            then I was surprised because I immediately saw Erika on my friend list in ml.<br>  
                            she did follow me back!!!! she chatted with me and she asked me if I was mad at her.<br>  
                            I said why I'm going to be angry<br>  
                            I'm not harboring anger toward him<br>  
                            I get angry sometimes because of his stupidity but it also disappears   suddenly.<br>  
                            I told him what happened in my life when she wasn't there<br>  
                            Even so, I still love Erika even though she did something to me that I should have avoided..<br>  
                            but I stalked him and saw something in his bio and his affinity<br>  
                            I know I was very sad at that time because of what happened to me and then<br>   I saw his affinity and bio<br>  
                            I cried for a while<br>  
                            I saw his bio says "I LOVE YOU EARL"<br>   I'm not sure about the boy name.<br>  
                            When I told him that she had a boyfriend, she said that she didn't love her and that she was just picking her up.<br>  
                            IT'S LIKE I'M ALWAYS A CHILD FOOLING ERIKA EVEN IF I KNOW HER BEHAVIOR.<br>  
                            I wondered why I love this person even though she hurt me several times and his love for me was never sincere.<br>  
                            maybe because I was always asking him to drive and hoping he would change for me.

                            I wish you a wonderful happy new year.<br>
                            but she did not respond<br>
                            She didn't even wish me happy birthday on my birthday.<br>
                            I hope she wishes me a happy birthday.<br>
                            and it's February and I'm happy because she might be happy if I wish him a happy birthday cause I still remember his birthday.<br>
                            I looked forward to his birthday again on February 7 at 12 midnight like I did last year<br>
                            I chatted with him happy birthday and I waited for him to go online, she went online for a while
                            but she didn't reply either<br>
                            I don't know what his problem is<br>
                            but I haven't chatted with him for several months because she doesn't pay attention to me.<br>
                            she has changed a lot since she got a boyfriend.
                            We only had a little conversation in January and February

                            I have no intention of getting back together with Erika<br> 
                            because of what she did to me before<br>
                            She really always says that we will make a comeback.<br>
                            but I really don't want that happen, because I think that if we make a comeback, she will still do the same to me<br>
                            I was really scared of what she was doing to me as if I had a trauma or a phobia<br> 
                            but at that time she invited me to play again to ml<br> 
                            and I saw that that guy/ erika boyfriend has disappeared from his bio and affinity.<br> 
                            so I feel comfortable talking to him again<br> 
                            and we played some games and talked about what happened to us in the past few months.<br> 
                            I don't want to call him love<br> 
                            Unexpectedly, we became comfortable with each other again and the spirit of our relations returned.<br> 
                            and that's when she called her love and we were happy again.
                            I hope we have more memories and conversations here in ml and endless love.

                            Erika chatted with me that day but I don't remember what day it was<br>     
                            but she chatted with me saying that his grandmother is dead<br>
                            I suddenly felt sad and told my family what happened to Erika's grandmother<br>
                            because I shared with them about Erika's grandmother before<br>
                            because Erika told me that her grandmother is the only one who is always by her side and she sleeps with her grandmother in the same room<br> and she is also the one who injects her grandmother for his diabetes medication.<br>
                            I was sad for Erika but give me time for her to spend time with her grandmother<br>
                            after that, i thought Erika will be ok again and she will never be sad about losing her grandmother.<br>
                            but it became worst because the people's in their house were always his enemies<br>
                            especially her aunt<br>
                            I want to help erika and give her advice at that time.

                            The longer our relations here at ml went on.<br>
                            I think Erika has become comfortable with me because she tells me what her problems are and she complains only to me.<br>
                            she said that she was very angry with his aunt that night<br> and I was very afraid of what she said that she was going to get his uncle's gun <br>and she was going to do something bad to that person and she didn't mention who it was but I knew if she was referring to it.<br>
                            I really want to help Erika so that she can feel better and stop thinking about bad things<br>
                            I tell him that we are only positive and she will just entertain himself by chatting with me.<br>
                            she was sad again because she said his aunt was going to change his last name.<br>
                            I told him that she can change that too when she grows up with nothing stopping him and doing what she wants and changing the things she should and wants to change.<br>
                            and I said not to worry and to be artistic because she will bring my last name too soon<br>
                            I'm here for you, I'll always be with you when you're sad and I'll sympathize with you in all your pain.

                            That day, our conversation always got longer.<br>
                            She told me that she was on a diet, i told him that she ate a lot of foods to gain her weight.<br>i told him jokingly<br>
                            and then i found out because she said that she is not allowed to gain more weight<br>
                            becuase of his brain disease<br>
                            she didn't tell me that before<br>
                            I felt sad for Erika because she controlled eating always because of his illness.<br>
                            I asked him if his disease can be cured or if she has to maintain his medicine for the rest of her life<br>
                            She said to me that she will maintain him for lifetime.<br>
                            my tears drop on my eyes, because i read a lot about such disease's that i just don't want to say <br>
                            and different diseases in the brain but I dont know what kind of brain disease she has.<br>
                            my tears suddenly flowed and my mind said that.....<br>
                            I just want to love this girl for life no matter what happens<br>
                            and I will take care of him and prevent him from what is forbidden to him<br>
                            my heart relly only belongs to him<br>
                            I only have one request to god<br>
                            I hope we will be together in the end and we will make a memorable memories that we will not forget the tears and joy we feel<br>
                            and i hope the love we gave to each other will not be lacking<br>
                            and we will carry all our memories until death, I LOVE YOU ERIKA SO MUCH.

                        Erika told me that she wants to work in a call center<br>

                        At first I always asked him why she wanted to work<br>
                        even though they were rich and his family supported him well.<br>

                        That's when I found out why she wanted to work as a call center<br>
                        because she was jealous of his friends who now work as call centers<br>

                        that time we practiced English, I supported him because she really wanted to work in a call center, from then on we chatted in English<br>

                        we're just laughing because our english isn't really that good HAHAHA<br>

                        I told him not to rush, it's not as easy to work as she thought<br>

                        it would be better if she finishes his studies first so that his job will be more stable<br>
                        and the salary will be higher compared to the call center that she envies so much<br>

                        for me she can work, I know that Erika is a brave woman and she doesn't just give up on her dreams<br>

                        if she hasn't done it now, I'm sure he'll do it again<br>

                        I'm glad because she's really desperate to work because she doesn't want to depend on his family

                            I told him that I told my mom and sister about what happened in his life.<br>
                            I apologized to him because I didn't tell him before I told my family<br>
                            but she said it's fine and she's just shy.<br>
                            after that, for a few days, I talked to my sister that maybe she could chat with Erika.<br>
                            she agreed with me and said that she would do it tonight<br>
                            and she chatted with Erika and asked if she was ok with what happened to her a few days ago<br>
                            and my sister wanted to know his age but Erika didn't tell her and I said <br>she's 17 now I'm not sure but that's what I remember.<br>
                            then Erika told me not to do that next time because she might chat with bad words like she's a bigot o pervert hahaha.<br>
                            and she said she was ashamed of my sister.<br>     
                            she likes that I always treat her like a princess, she watched the new little mermaid movie today, Ariel is the star and she likes Ariel because they share the same life story.<br>  <br>
